{"question": "Question: Discuss the role of neurotransmitters in the regulation of mood, and how imbalances can lead to mood disorders.\nStudent's Answer: Neurotransmitters are chemicals in the brain that transmit signals between neurons. They play a crucial role in regulating mood. For instance, serotonin and dopamine are neurotransmitters that are heavily involved in mood regulation. An imbalance in serotonin levels is often linked to depression, while dopamine is associated with pleasure and reward, and its imbalance can lead to disorders such as bipolar disorder. Treatments for mood disorders often aim to correct these imbalances using medications that affect neurotransmitter levels.\nPlease provide \"Score\", \"Scoring Details\", and \"Personalized Feedback\" based on the question and student's answer, in JSON format.", "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Score\": 85,\n  \"Scoring_Details\": {\n    \"Accuracy\": 90,\n    \"Comprehension\": 85,\n    \"Depth\": 75,\n    \"Clarity\": 100\n  },\n  \"Personalized_Feedback\": \"Your explanation of the role of neurotransmitters in mood regulation is clear and accurate.

{"question": "Question: Discuss the role of neurotransmitters in the regulation of mood, and how imbalances can lead to mood disorders.\nStudent's Answer: Neurotransmitters are chemicals in the brain that transmit signals between neurons.

{"question": "Question: Discuss the role of neurotransmitters in the regulation of mood, and how imbalances can lead to mood disorders.\nStudent's Answer: Neurotransmitters are chemicals in the brain that transmit signals between neurons. They play a crucial role in regulating mood. For instance, serotonin and dopamine are neurotransmitters that are heavily involved in mood regulation. An imbalance in serotonin levels is often linked to depression, while dopamine is associated with pleasure and reward, and its imbalance can lead to disorders such as bipolar disorder.

These modifications do not alter the DNA sequence itself but can change how genes are expressed. They include processes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA interactions. During cellular differentiation, these mechanisms help to ensure that cells develop into their specific types with unique functions.\\n\\n1. **DNA Methylation**: This involves the addition of a methyl group (-CH3) to the cytosine base of DNA, typically at CpG dinucleotides. In differentiated cells, DNA methylation is often associated with gene silencing. For example, in early embryonic development, certain genes are methylated to prevent their expression in somatic cells, ensuring that they only function in germ cells or other specialized cell types.\\n\\n2. **Histone Modifications**: Histones are proteins around which DNA wraps to form chromatin. Various chemical modifications to histones (such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation) can affect the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Acetylation of histones generally leads to an open chromatin structure, allowing for increased gene expression, while deacetylation leads to a closed chromatin structure, reducing gene expression. Similarly, methylation of histones at different positions can either activate or repress gene expression.\\n\\n3. **Non-Coding RNAs**: These molecules, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), can regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. They can bind to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and promote their degradation or inhibit translation, thus controlling protein production. During differentiation, specific sets of non-coding RNAs are activated or silenced to guide the cell towards its intended fate.\\n\\nOverall, epigenetic modifications provide a flexible yet stable mechanism for regulating gene expression during cellular differentiation.

During differentiation, cells undergo specific changes in their epigenetic marks that lead to the activation or repression of certain genes, thereby determining the cell's fate. For example, DNA methylation typically represses gene expression by adding methyl groups to the cytosine bases in CpG islands, often located near gene promoters. Histone modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, can either promote or inhibit gene transcription depending on the specific modification and its location on the histone tail.

These modifications include methylation of DNA, histone modification (such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination), and changes in chromatin structure. During differentiation, cells acquire distinct fates and functions, and this process is tightly controlled through epigenetic mechanisms.\\n\\n1. **DNA Methylation**: This involves the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine base of DNA. In general, methylation at CpG islands (regions with high concentrations of cytosine and guanine nucleotides) can lead to gene silencing. As cells differentiate, specific genes become methylated, which can inhibit their transcription and prevent them from being expressed in the differentiated cell type. Conversely, genes that need to be activated for the new function may have their promoter regions demethylated, allowing for their expression.\\n\\n2. **Histone Modifications**: Histones are proteins around which DNA wraps, forming structures called nucleosomes. The modification of histones, such as acetylation, can affect the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and RNA polymerase, thereby influencing gene expression. Acetylation of histones typically leads to relaxed chromatin structure and increased transcriptional activity, while deacetylation has the opposite effect. Other modifications like methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination also contribute to the regulation of gene expression by changing the interaction between histones and DNA, thus affecting chromatin structure.\\n\\n3. **Chromatin Structure Changes**: Chromatin remodeling involves the alteration of the structure of chromatin through various processes such as nucleosome positioning and the replacement of histones with variant histones. These changes can either open up or close down the accessibility of DNA to transcription machinery, thereby controlling gene expression. For example, during differentiation, certain chromatin regions may become more condensed, making the DNA less accessible and reducing gene expression, while other regions may become more open, enhancing gene expression.\\n\\nThese epigenetic changes are often heritable, meaning they can persist through cell division and contribute to the stable differences between cell types. They are reversible and responsive to environmental cues, allowing for dynamic regulation of gene expression throughout an organism's development and in response to external stimuli. This flexibility is essential for cellular plasticity and adaptation, enabling cells to change their state in response to developmental signals or environmental conditions.\"\n}\n```", "model": "qwen2.5-7b-instruct", "score": "```json\n{\n  \"detailed_scores\": [\n    {\n      \"principle\": \"Instruction Following & Task Completion\",\n      \"score\": 10,\n      \"reason\": \"The answer fully adheres to the requested JSON format and comprehensively addresses the question.

{"question": "Question: Explain the role of microRNAs in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.\nStudent's Answer: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. They primarily function by binding to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, usually resulting in gene silencing. This silencing occurs through two main mechanisms: mRNA degradation and translational repression. When miRNAs pair with their target mRNA with perfect or near-perfect complementarity, the mRNA is usually cleaved and degraded. When the pairing is imperfect, translation of the mRNA is typically repressed. Additionally, miRNAs are involved in various cellular processes such as development, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism.

These include high capital costs for aircraft, airport landing slots, regulatory approvals, and brand loyalty among existing airlines. Additionally, the need for extensive networks and routes makes it difficult for new players to compete effectively.\\n\\n2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: The bargaining power of suppliers in the airline industry is moderate. Key suppliers include aircraft manufacturers, fuel providers, and maintenance services. While these suppliers are essential, airlines often have multiple options for sourcing aircraft or fuel, which mitigates supplier power.\\n\\n3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**: The bargaining power of buyers in the airline industry is high due to the abundance of choices available to consumers. Online platforms and travel agencies provide easy access to price comparisons, leading to intense competition among airlines. Additionally, the commoditization of air travel means that customers can easily switch between carriers if they find better deals or service elsewhere.\\n\\n4. **Threat of Substitute Products or Services**: The threat of substitutes is high in the airline industry. Alternatives such as train, bus, car rental, and even video conferencing can substitute for air travel depending on the distance, cost, and urgency of travel. For shorter distances, ground transportation can be faster and more convenient, while longer distances might see increased competition from emerging technologies like hyperloop systems.\\n\\n5. **Intensity of Rivalry Among Existing Competitors**: Competition within the airline industry is extremely intense. Airlines frequently engage in price wars, especially during off-peak seasons, to attract customers. High fixed costs and low variable costs mean that airlines must maintain high occupancy rates to remain profitable, leading to frequent promotions and discounts.

It helps in understanding the intensity of competition, the potential for profitability, and the attractiveness of an industry. The five forces include: Threat of New Entrants, Bargaining Power of Suppliers, Bargaining Power of Buyers, Threat of Substitutes, and Competitive Rivalry. For this analysis, we will use the smartphone industry as an example.\",\n    \"Threat of New Entrants\": \"The smartphone industry has a moderate threat of new entrants. While the market is dominated by major players like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei, the barriers to entry are relatively high due to the need for substantial capital investment, advanced technology, and strong brand recognition. However, the rise of Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi and Oppo shows that new entrants can still make an impact, especially in emerging markets.\",\n    \"Bargaining Power of Suppliers\": \"The bargaining power of suppliers in the smartphone industry is relatively low. Components such as processors, screens, and batteries are often commoditized and sourced from multiple suppliers. However, some suppliers, like those providing unique or patented components (e.g., Qualcomm for chips), have more leverage. Overall, the high number of suppliers reduces their individual bargaining power.\",\n    \"Bargaining Power of Buyers\": \"The bargaining power of buyers in the smartphone industry is high. Consumers have a wide range of choices and can easily switch brands based on price, features, and brand loyalty. Additionally, the rise of e-commerce platforms has made it easier for buyers to compare prices and find the best deals, further increasing their bargaining power.\",\n    \"Threat of Substitutes\": \"The threat of substitutes in the smartphone industry is moderate. While there are no direct substitutes for smartphones, other devices like tablets, laptops, and wearables can perform some of the same functions. Additionally, advancements in technology could lead to new types of devices that could potentially replace smartphones in the future.\",\n    \"Competitive Rivalry\": \"The competitive rivalry in the smartphone industry is extremely high. The market is saturated with numerous competitors, each constantly innovating to outdo the others. Major players like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei engage in fierce competition through product differentiation, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns. This intense rivalry drives innovation but also puts pressure on profit margins.\",\n    \"Conclusion\": \"Using Porter's Five Forces model, we can see that the smartphone industry is highly competitive with significant pressures from buyers and rivals. While the threat of new entrants and substitutes is moderate, the bargaining power of suppliers is relatively low.

Please generate the corresponding answer based on the question. \"Answer\":, in JSON format.", "response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (EMSO) have become a critical component of modern military strategy due to their ability to shape the electromagnetic environment and influence the outcome of battles. These operations encompass a broad range of activities including electronic warfare (EW), information operations (IO), and cyber operations that leverage the electromagnetic spectrum for offensive and defensive purposes. Here’s an analysis of their strategic significance and how they can alter the dynamics of warfare:\\n\\n1. **Control Over Information and Communication**: In contemporary conflicts, control over information and communication channels is paramount. EMSO allows forces to disrupt or manipulate these channels, thereby gaining a significant advantage. By jamming enemy communications or spoofing signals, one can disorient and demoralize the adversary, making it difficult for them to coordinate effectively.\\n\\n2. **Enhanced Situational Awareness**: Advanced EMSO capabilities enable military units to gather intelligence and monitor enemy movements more effectively. Through sophisticated surveillance technologies and signal analysis, commanders can gain real-time insights into the battlefield, enhancing decision-making processes and enabling timely responses to threats.\\n\\n3. **Protection Against Cyber Threats**: With the increasing reliance on digital systems, the electromagnetic spectrum has become a critical battleground for cyber warfare. EMSO strategies can be employed to protect friendly networks from cyber-attacks while simultaneously launching attacks against enemy systems, thus altering the balance of power in favor of the aggressor.\\n\\n4. **Disruption of Command and Control Systems**: Modern militaries heavily depend on integrated command and control systems to manage operations efficiently. By targeting these systems through EMSO, adversaries can cause significant disruptions, leading to confusion and reduced effectiveness among enemy forces.\\n\\n5. **Integration with Kinetic Operations**: EMSO can be seamlessly integrated with traditional kinetic operations such as air strikes, artillery fire, and ground assaults. For instance, by using electronic warfare to suppress enemy air defenses, friendly forces can achieve greater freedom of action and reduce risks associated with kinetic engagements.\\n\\nIn conclusion, EMSO represents a transformative force multiplier in modern warfare, offering unprecedented opportunities for shaping the electromagnetic environment to achieve strategic objectives.

In the context of industrial automation, RL can be used to optimize processes by learning the best control policies that lead to optimal performance metrics such as efficiency, cost reduction, and quality improvement.\\n\\nOne specific algorithm that can be applied in this scenario is the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). DDPG is a model-free off-policy actor-critic algorithm designed for environments with continuous action spaces, which makes it suitable for controlling complex systems in industrial settings.\\n\\n### Application Example: Optimizing Conveyor Belt Speeds\\nConsider an industrial setting where products move along conveyor belts through various stages of processing. The speed of these conveyor belts needs to be optimized to balance between throughput (the number of products processed per unit time) and energy consumption. Traditional methods might involve manual adjustments based on empirical data or simple heuristic rules, but these approaches may not always yield optimal results.\\n\\n**How DDPG Can Be Applied:**\\n1. **Environment Setup**: Define the state space as the current throughput rate, energy consumption level, and possibly other relevant factors like product queue lengths at different stages. The action space consists of adjusting the speed of the conveyor belts within a predefined range.\\n2. **Reward Function Design**: The reward function should incentivize high throughput while penalizing excessive energy consumption. For instance, a positive reward could be given for each product processed, and a penalty could be imposed for every unit increase in energy usage above a baseline level.\\n3. **Training Process**: The DDPG algorithm interacts with the simulated environment (which could be a digital twin of the actual system) by proposing speed adjustments (actions) based on the current state. Over time, the algorithm learns to propose actions that lead to higher rewards, effectively optimizing the process.\\n4. **Deployment**: Once the training phase is complete, the learned policy can be deployed in the real-world system, allowing for dynamic adjustment of conveyor belt speeds based on real-time conditions.\\n\\nBy leveraging RL techniques like DDPG, industrial automation processes can become more adaptive and efficient, leading to significant improvements in operational performance.\"\n}", "model": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "score": "```json\n{\n  \"detailed_scores\": [\n    {\n      \"principle\": \"Instruction Following & Task Completion\",\n      \"score\": 9,\n      \"reason\": \"The answer fully addresses all parts of the question: it explains RL's role in industrial automation, provides DDPG as the example algorithm, and details a concrete application.

Strategically, EMSO encompasses the exploitation, attack, protection, and management of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) to achieve operational objectives. Its significance lies in three key areas: **intelligence superiority**, **denial and deception**, and **force multiplication**.\\n\\n1. **Intelligence Superiority**: EMSO enables real-time surveillance, signals intelligence (SIGINT), and electronic warfare (EW) capabilities. Advanced radar, communications intercepts, and spectrum-sensing technologies allow militaries to detect, identify, and track adversarial systems, providing a decisive edge in situational awareness. For instance, passive sensing via EMS minimizes detection risks while gathering critical data on enemy movements.\\n\\n2. **Denial and Deception**: EMSO disrupts adversaries' command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) systems through jamming, spoofing, and cyber-electronic integration. By degrading GPS, radar, and communication networks, EMSO creates operational paralysis, as seen in Ukraine's use of EW to neutralize Russian drone operations. Deception tactics, such as false radar signatures, misdirect enemy resources, complicating their decision-making cycles (OODA loop).\\n\\n3. **Force Multiplication**: EMSO synergizes with multi-domain operations (MDO), enhancing precision strikes and network-centric warfare. Secure, resilient communications (e.g., frequency-hopping radios) ensure coordination across land, sea, air, space, and cyber domains. Conversely, offensive EMSO capabilities, like high-power microwaves, can disable electronic infrastructure without kinetic engagement, reducing collateral damage.\\n\\nEMSO reshapes warfare dynamics by prioritizing **information dominance** over sheer firepower. It enables asymmetric advantages, where technologically inferior forces can challenge superior adversaries through agile spectrum warfare. However, challenges persist, including spectrum congestion, adversarial counter-EMS technologies, and the need for adaptive AI-driven spectrum management. Future trends, such as cognitive EW and integration with quantum technologies, will further solidify EMSO's role as a decisive factor in 21st-century conflicts.\"\n}\n```", "model": "deepseek-r1", "score": "```json\n{\n  \"detailed_scores\": [\n    {\n      \"principle\": \"Instruction Following & Task Completion\",\n      \"score\": 9,\n      \"reason\": \"The answer fully addresses the question by analyzing EMSO's strategic significance and its impact on warfare dynamics.

The agent interacts with the environment (e.g., a manufacturing line) by taking actions (e.g., adjusting machine parameters) and receiving feedback in the form of rewards (e.g., reduced energy consumption or increased throughput). The goal is to learn a policy that maps states to actions in a way that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.\",\n    \"Example Algorithm\": \"One commonly used RL algorithm in industrial automation is **Q-Learning**. Q-Learning is a model-free algorithm that learns the value of actions in particular states, represented by a Q-value.

The goal is to minimize the time taken to assemble a product while maintaining quality. The states could represent the current configuration of the assembly line (e.g., positions of robots, status of parts), and the actions could be the movements or operations performed by the robots.

{"question": "Question: Explain the role of microRNAs in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.\nStudent's Answer: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. They primarily function by binding to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, usually resulting in gene silencing. This silencing occurs through two main mechanisms: mRNA degradation and translational repression. When miRNAs pair with their target mRNA with perfect or near-perfect complementarity, the mRNA is usually cleaved and degraded. When the pairing is imperfect, translation of the mRNA is typically repressed. Additionally, miRNAs are involved in various cellular processes such as development, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism.

{"question": "Question: Explain the role of microRNAs in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.\nStudent's Answer: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. They primarily function by binding to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, usually resulting in gene silencing. This silencing occurs through two main mechanisms: mRNA degradation and translational repression. When miRNAs pair with their target mRNA with perfect or near-perfect complementarity, the mRNA is usually cleaved and degraded. When the pairing is imperfect, translation of the mRNA is typically repressed. Additionally, miRNAs are involved in various cellular processes such as development, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism.

Do not provide the answer directly.. \"Reasoning Provided\":, return in JSON format", "response": "{\n\"reasoning\": \"Porter's Five Forces framework is a tool for analyzing the competitive landscape of an industry by identifying and assessing five key competitive forces. These forces help to determine the attractiveness of an industry and the profitability of its potential returns. The first force is the threat of new entrants, which evaluates how easy or difficult it is for new competitors to enter the market. High barriers to entry, such as capital requirements, regulatory restrictions, and customer loyalty to existing brands, can limit new competition. The second force is the threat of substitute products or services, which considers the availability and appeal of alternative offerings that can satisfy similar needs. If there are many viable substitutes, the bargaining power of suppliers and buyers increases, and the industry's profitability decreases. The third force is the bargaining power of suppliers, which looks at how much control suppliers have over the price and quality of inputs. Suppliers with limited alternatives can exert significant pressure on companies within the industry. The fourth force is the bargaining power of buyers, which assesses the ability of customers to drive down prices or demand higher quality. This is often influenced by the number of buyers, their purchasing volume, and the cost of switching to another supplier.

{"question": "Question: Explain the role of microRNAs in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.\nStudent's Answer: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. They primarily function by binding to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, usually resulting in gene silencing. This silencing occurs through two main mechanisms: mRNA degradation and translational repression. When miRNAs pair with their target mRNA with perfect or near-perfect complementarity, the mRNA is usually cleaved and degraded. When the pairing is imperfect, translation of the mRNA is typically repressed. Additionally, miRNAs are involved in various cellular processes such as development, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism. Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been linked to numerous diseases, including cancer.\nPlease provide \"Score\", \"Scoring Details\", and \"Personalized Feedback\" based on the question and student's answer, in JSON format.", "response": "{\n  \"Score\": 90,\n  \"Scoring Details\": {\n    \"Completeness\": 4.5,\n    \"Accuracy\": 5.0,\n    \"Clarity\": 4.5,\n    \"Depth\": 4.0,\n    \"Relevance\": 5.0\n  },\n  \"Personalized Feedback\": \"Your answer effectively outlines the core role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in gene regulation, including their mechanisms of action (degradation vs. translational repression) and their biological significance.

Let's analyze each option: A) Roots - Roots are primarily responsible for absorbing water and nutrients from the soil, but they are not exposed to light and lack the structures needed for photosynthesis. B) Stems - While stems can sometimes perform photosynthesis, especially in plants with green stems, their primary role is to support the plant and transport water, nutrients, and food. C) Leaves - Leaves are typically flat and broad, maximizing their surface area to capture sunlight. They contain chloroplasts, the organelles where photosynthesis occurs, making them the primary site for this process.

Do not provide the answer directly.. \"Reasoning Provided\":, return in JSON format", "response": "{\n  \"Reasoning Provided\": [\n    \"In military operations, the concept of controlling high ground is often emphasized due to several strategic advantages it offers. Firstly, from an elevated position, forces can achieve a better line of sight over the battlefield, allowing for superior observation and reconnaissance capabilities. This enhanced visibility not only aids in spotting enemy movements but also in directing friendly fire more accurately, potentially turning the tide of battle. Additionally, being on higher ground can provide a psychological edge, as it may demoralize the opposing force by making them feel constantly observed or under threat.

These plates float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them and move relative to each other. The formation of mountains through plate tectonics involves several key processes. When two tectonic plates collide, one is often forced under the other in a process called subduction. As these plates converge, the denser oceanic plate (if one exists) sinks into the Earth's mantle, creating a subduction zone. This sinking causes the other, less dense plate to be pushed upwards, leading to the uplift of the land and eventually the formation of mountain ranges. Additionally, the friction and pressure at the collision boundary can cause rock to crumble and break, forming faults and folds that contribute to the elevation of the terrain. Over time, as more material is added through volcanic activity or sediment deposition, the mountains grow higher.

Do not provide the answer directly.. \"Reasoning Provided\":, return in JSON format", "response": "{\n  \"Reasoning Provided\": \"To understand how plate tectonics can lead to the formation of mountains, one must first consider the structure and dynamics of the Earth's crust. The Earth's outer shell is not a single, solid piece but is divided into several large and small pieces known as tectonic plates. These plates float on the semi-fluid layer of the mantle beneath them, called the asthenosphere, and are in constant, albeit very slow, motion. This movement is driven by convection currents within the Earth's mantle, which are influenced by the heat generated from the decay of radioactive elements in the core and lower mantle. As these tectonic plates move, they interact with each other at their boundaries. There are three main types of interactions: convergent, divergent, and transform. In the context of mountain formation, the focus is primarily on convergent boundaries, where two plates move towards each other. When an oceanic plate collides with a continental plate, the denser oceanic plate typically subducts (dives) beneath the lighter continental plate. This process, known as subduction, can lead to the formation of volcanic arcs, but it also plays a role in mountain building. However, when two continental plates collide, neither can subduct due to their similar densities. Instead, the collision results in intense compression, causing the crust to buckle and fold. Over millions of years, this folding and faulting, combined with erosion and deposition processes, leads to the uplift and formation of mountain ranges. Additionally, the pressure and heat generated during these collisions can cause metamorphism, transforming existing rocks into new forms, further contributing to the complex geology of mountain regions. Thus, the dynamic interplay between tectonic plates, driven by the Earth's internal heat, is a key mechanism in the creation of mountains.\"\n}", "model": "qwen-max", "score": "```json\n{\n  \"detailed_scores\": [\n    {\n      \"principle\": \"Instruction Following & Task Completion\",\n      \"score\": 10,\n      \"reason\": \"The answer fully adheres to the instructions by providing detailed reasoning (not a direct answer) in the required JSON format.

{"question": "Question: Explain the role of microRNAs in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.\nStudent's Answer: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. They primarily function by binding to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, usually resulting in gene silencing. This silencing occurs through two main mechanisms: mRNA degradation and translational repression. When miRNAs pair with their target mRNA with perfect or near-perfect complementarity, the mRNA is usually cleaved and degraded. When the pairing is imperfect, translation of the mRNA is typically repressed. Additionally, miRNAs are involved in various cellular processes such as development, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism.

{"question": "Question: Explain the concept of Nash Equilibrium in game theory and provide an example.\nStudent's Answer: Nash Equilibrium is a situation in a game where each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies of all other players. No player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged. An example would be the Prisoner's Dilemma, where both prisoners choose to betray each other although they would receive a better outcome if they both stayed silent.\nPlease provide \"Score\", \"Scoring Details\", and \"Personalized Feedback\" based on the question and student's answer, in JSON format.", "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Score\": 8,\n  \"Scoring Details\": {\n    \"Concept Explanation\": 4,\n    \"Example Provided\": 4,\n    \"Clarity and Accuracy\": 0\n  },\n  \"Personalized Feedback\": \"Your explanation of Nash Equilibrium is accurate and concise, capturing the essence of the concept well. The example of the Prisoner's Dilemma is also appropriate and effectively illustrates the idea of Nash Equilibrium. However, the explanation could be slightly improved by mentioning that in Nash Equilibrium, no player has an incentive to deviate unilaterally from their strategy. Additionally, while the example is correct, it might be beneficial to briefly explain why both prisoners choosing to betray each other constitutes a Nash Equilibrium. Overall, good job!\"\n}\n```", "model": "deepseek-v3", "score": "```json\n{\n  \"detailed_scores\": [\n    {\n      \"principle\": \"Instruction Following & Task Completion\",\n      \"score\": 8,\n      \"reason\": \"The answer accurately explains Nash Equilibrium and provides a relevant example.
