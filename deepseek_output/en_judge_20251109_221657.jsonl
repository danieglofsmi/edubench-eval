These components form a continuous feedback loop where the sensor measures the output, the comparator calculates error, the controller processes this error, and the actuator adjusts the process accordingly. This feedback mechanism allows the system to automatically compensate for disturbances and maintain stability. Compared to open-loop control (which has no feedback and operates based only on predetermined inputs), closed-loop control offers advantages including: 1) Disturbance rejection - automatically compensates for external disturbances; 2) Improved accuracy - continuously corrects errors between desired and actual outputs; 3) Better stability - maintains system performance despite parameter variations.", "GradingCriteria": "Total score: 10 points.

{"Subject": "Chemistry", "Level": "Master", "QuestionType": "Short Answer", "Question": "Explain the thermodynamic and kinetic factors that govern the selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Discuss how these factors can be manipulated to achieve chemoselective reduction of either the C=C double bond or the carbonyl group.", "StandardAnswer": "The selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds is governed by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Thermodynamically, hydrogenation of the C=C bond is more favorable (ΔG ≈ -30 kcal/mol) compared to the C=O bond (ΔG ≈ -15 kcal/mol) due to the higher bond energy of C=O (∼179 kcal/mol) versus C=C (∼146 kcal/mol). However, kinetic factors often override thermodynamic preferences. The C=C bond is more accessible to the catalyst surface and has lower activation energy for hydrogenation. To achieve chemoselective reduction: 1) For C=C reduction: Use heterogeneous catalysts (Pd, Pt, Ni) under mild conditions (1 atm H₂, 25°C), as these favor alkene hydrogenation due to better surface adsorption of C=C bonds. 2) For C=O reduction: Use homogeneous catalysts like Ru complexes with specific ligands that can coordinate to the oxygen atom, or operate at higher H₂ pressures (50-100 atm) and temperatures (80-120°C) to overcome the kinetic barrier.

Discuss how the adsorption energies of key reaction intermediates influence the overall reaction kinetics and overpotential, and explain why platinum remains a benchmark catalyst despite its limitations.", "StandardAnswer": "The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt(111) in acidic media (0.5 M H₂SO₄) proceeds through either a 4-electron direct pathway to water or a 2-electron pathway to hydrogen peroxide, with the 4-electron pathway being dominant on platinum. The mechanism involves: (1) O₂ adsorption and dissociation, (2) sequential proton-electron transfer steps forming OOH*, O*, and OH* intermediates, and (3) water formation and desorption. Thermodynamically, the reaction is driven by the strong reduction potential (E° = 1.23 V vs. SHE) and the negative free energy change (ΔG = -nFE). The adsorption energies of O*, OH*, and OOH* intermediates follow a linear scaling relationship: ΔG_OOH = ΔG_OH + 3.2 ± 0.2 eV. This creates a fundamental limitation known as the 'thermodynamic overpotential' of ~0.3-0.4 V, as the scaling relationship prevents all steps from being simultaneously thermoneutral. The rate-determining step is typically the reduction of OH* to H₂O, with its adsorption energy serving as the primary descriptor for ORR activity.

Discuss their relative advantages, limitations, and potential applications in therapeutic contexts, with specific emphasis on precision, efficiency, and safety considerations.", "StandardAnswer": "CRISPR-Cas9 utilizes a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 nuclease to specific genomic loci, creating double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are repaired by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). This results in insertions/deletions (indels) or precise edits, respectively. Base editing, however, uses catalytically impaired Cas9 fused to deaminase enzymes (cytidine or adenosine deaminases) that chemically convert one base pair to another without creating DSBs. Cytosine base editors (CBEs) convert C•G to T•A, while adenine base editors (ABEs) convert A•T to G•C.\n\nAdvantages: CRISPR-Cas9 enables diverse edits including gene knockouts and large insertions. Base editing offers higher precision for point mutations without DSBs, reducing indel formation and improving safety.\n\nLimitations: CRISPR-Cas9 can cause off-target effects and relies on error-prone DNA repair. Base editing is restricted to specific base transitions (C→T, A→G) and requires a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) near the target base.\n\nApplications: CRISPR-Cas9 is suited for gene knockout studies and inserting therapeutic genes.

Oxygen demand calculation: 300-500 g O2/kg feed for salmonids.\n\n3. CO2 Stripping: Cascade or packed column degassers maintain CO2 <15 mg/L to prevent pH depression and respiratory stress. pH control via sodium bicarbonate addition maintains 7.0-7.5 range.\n\n4. Monitoring and Control: Automated sensors for DO, pH, temperature, ORP with alarm systems. Water exchange rate typically 5-15% daily to prevent metabolite accumulation.\n\n5. Biosecurity: UV (30-40 mJ/cm²) or ozone (0.1-0.3 mg/L residual) disinfection prevents pathogen introduction.

Explain the key economic forces that determine this rate and discuss how changes in matching efficiency, job separation rate, and workers' bargaining power affect the equilibrium unemployment level.", "StandardAnswer": "The DMP model characterizes unemployment as the outcome of search frictions in the labor market. The key equation is the matching function: m = m(u, v), where m is the number of matches, u is unemployment, and v is vacancies. Defining labor market tightness as θ = v/u, the job-finding rate is f(θ) = m(u,v)/u = m(1, θ) and the vacancy-filling rate is q(θ) = m(u,v)/v = m(1/θ, 1).\n\nThe steady-state unemployment condition requires that inflows equal outflows: s(1-u) = f(θ)u, where s is the exogenous job separation rate. Solving for u gives: u = s / [s + f(θ)]. This is the Beveridge curve relationship.\n\nThe equilibrium is closed by the job creation condition from the firm's profit maximization. The value of a filled job J satisfies: rJ = p - w - sJ, where r is discount rate, p is productivity, and w is wage. The value of a vacancy V satisfies: rV = -c + q(θ)(J - V), where c is vacancy cost. With free entry, V = 0, so J = c/q(θ).\n\nWages are determined by Nash bargaining: w = argmax[(W - U)^β(J - V)^(1-β)], where β is worker bargaining power, W is value of employment, and U is value of unemployment. This yields: w = βp + (1-β)rU.\n\nThe job creation condition becomes: (p - w)/(r + s) = c/q(θ). Substituting the wage equation: [p - βp - (1-β)rU]/(r + s) = c/q(θ). Using rU = z + f(θ)(W - U) = z + β/(1-β)cθ (where z is unemployment benefits), we get the final job creation condition: (1-β)(p - z)/(r + s) - βcθ = c/q(θ).\n\nThis equation jointly with u = s/[s + f(θ)] determines equilibrium (θ*, u*).\n\nKey economic forces: (1) Matching efficiency affects f(θ) and q(θ) - higher efficiency reduces unemployment; (2) Job separation rate s directly increases unemployment through the Beveridge curve; (3) Worker bargaining power β affects wage pressure - higher β reduces job creation and increases unemployment.", "GradingCriteria": "Total Score: 20 points\n\nScoring Breakdown:\n- Correct derivation of steady-state unemployment rate from flow equilibrium (4 points)\n- Proper specification of matching function and transition rates (3 points)\n- Derivation and explanation of job creation condition (4 points)\n- Incorporation of wage determination through Nash bargaining (3 points)\n- Analysis of how matching efficiency affects equilibrium (2 points)\n- Analysis of how job separation rate affects equilibrium (2 points)\n- Analysis of how bargaining power affects equilibrium (2 points)", "StudentAnswer": "The DMP model shows that unemployment comes from search frictions.

When matching efficiency increases, unemployment should decrease because it's easier to find workers. Higher separation rates obviously increase unemployment because more people lose jobs.
