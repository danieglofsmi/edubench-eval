    "Question: Explain the role of microRNAs in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.\nStudent's Answer: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. They primarily function by binding to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, usually resulting in gene silencing. This silencing occurs through two main mechanisms: mRNA degradation and translational repression. When miRNAs pair with their target mRNA with perfect or near-perfect complementarity, the mRNA is usually cleaved and degraded. When the pairing is imperfect, translation of the mRNA is typically repressed. Additionally, miRNAs are involved in various cellular processes such as development, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism. Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been linked to numerous diseases, including cancer.\nPlease provide \"Score\", \"Scoring Details\", and \"Personalized Feedback\" based on the question and student's answer, in JSON format.",

    "Question: Explain the role of microRNAs in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.\nStudent's Answer: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. They primarily function by binding to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, usually resulting in gene silencing. This silencing occurs through two main mechanisms: mRNA degradation and translational repression. When miRNAs pair with their target mRNA with perfect or near-perfect complementarity, the mRNA is usually cleaved and degraded. When the pairing is imperfect, translation of the mRNA is typically repressed. Additionally, miRNAs are involved in various cellular processes such as development, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism. Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been linked to numerous diseases, including cancer.\nPlease provide \"Score\", \"Scoring Details\", and \"Personalized Feedback\" based on the question and student's answer, in JSON format.",
